A* (A star) is a great tool for solving navigational problems.

Gridworld is a program to navigate in a grid from a start position to a goal. Obstacles can be placed in the grid. The program uses A* to compute the best path. This program is a good introduction to A* and heap data structure.

Grid are specified using text files. A sample grid would like this.

s _ _ _
x _ _ x
_ x _ g

where 
s is start.
g is goal.
x is a obstacle
_ is an open cell.

The main class is called Astar and it is run with the following arguments

-i 4.txt -d f -t s
where
i the filename specifying the grid
d the direction of the search  forwards or backwards from the goal. Valid values are 
	f forward
        b backward
t how to solve tie breaks. Valid values are
	s prefer smaller g-values
     	l prefer larger g-values 

Coming soon: Adaptive A* - where the program learns from its mistakes and updates its heuristics compared to the fixed Manhattan distance heuristic used in grid solvers.
